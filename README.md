Demo code of SEA.

The implementation is based on the code and data of MTransE. Thanks Dr.Muhao for his fundamental work and contributions.

This version is based on entity-level alignment, instead of triple-level alignment.

Usage:

To run the code, you need to have Python3 and Tensorflow installed.

The frequence of 20% or others need to be specified by manual, for example:
15000 records with frequence. you need to specify the frequence of 15000*(20%...) = 3000th entity in the whole record.
I have not implemented the function for automatic opertion. I will finish it in later.
